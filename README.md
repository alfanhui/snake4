Snake with portals - Quakathon 2017

This project started out at Dundee University Quakathon in January 2017 (24hour hackathon). We made great progress on the day, but didn't actually make a working verison.
You can see our last version on the day of the hackathon here: [3879b84 on 6 Jan 2017](https://github.com/alfanhui/snake4/commit/3879b84bdf08b64fdffa803958108415652b4d0b).

Feeling partially to blame for the lack of a working prototype due to missunderstand the way location were stored (multi-dimentional array over single array for grid locations), I have taken up this project post-hackathon to complete it as we had envisioned.

## How to Run

```bash
./mvnw compile exec:exec
```
